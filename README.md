# Hello There 
### About Me
```rust
pub struct Human {
    name: String, age: i8,
    interests: Vec<&'static str>
}
fn main() {
    let me = Human { 
        name: "Max M".to_string(),
        age: 15, 
	interests: [
            "programing",
            "nordic skiing",
            "snowboarding",
            "building computers"
        ].to_vec() 
    };
}
```
### Current Projects
```json
{
	"baffler": "A transpiled programing language implemented in rust and converted to typescript",
	"...": "thats it lol I have nothing else going on right now"
}
```
### About Me (Again)
Currently I am improving my proficency in rust because of its fast compile times and interesting background with the borrow checker. I am proficent in Python, JavaScript, Typescript and HTML and CSS if I dare to say they are programing languages. I am currently looking for an internship at a fast growing software development company where I can gain to low level experince and interact with the hardware. I am a sophmore in high school and love learning.

### HELP ME
I people lead busy lives but if while looking at my sh\*t code and see a vurnarability or just something that I did was stupid throw up a pull request and show me how its done! I am open to suggestions and would love to improve my coding skills.
